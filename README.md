# tictactoe
My first JS Development Project! Literally completed it today. 

This is utilizing the traditional logic for the game,Tic-Tac-Toe
Currently, there is no GUI other than basic graphical elements and notifications when the game has been won.
Looking to implement some more features such as:
-Render "Game Draw": when all spaces are taken up and no winner
-Personalize victory message
-Keep track of winner, player 1/2 with a score tracker
